# A resource (passenger) data file downloaded from 
# https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
# for a month before July of 2016.
# Required parameter
####
# Yellow Taxi Trip Records of June 1, 2016 such that tpep_pickup_datetime is between

# Required parameter
####

# A KML file defining a bounding polygon of the simulated area. The bounding polygon 
# will be used to crop the map. While the map usually covers a rectangular area,

# the agents will be deployed.
# Required parameter

#     road_speed  =  speed_limit / speed_reduction

# in TLC Yellow data for the trips in Manhattan.
# Required parameter
####

# The seed of the random number generator for agents placement.
# Set the seed to be a positive value when repeatability is needed (e.g., when debugging).
# If the provided value is negative, the seed will be randomly generated when 
# COMSET starts (and thus the simulation results would not be repeatable). 
# Optional parameter; default to 1
